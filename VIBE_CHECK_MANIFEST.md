# ☠️ Vibe Check Manifesto ☠️

Welcome to **Is This Tech Dead?**, where the vibes are off, the hope is low, and the sarcasm is professionally curated. This ain’t your dad’s startup README. This is where we embrace the end times of software trends with bitter grins and black coffee.

## 📜 Guidelines for the Vibe™️

These are not "style rules" they’re survival tactics for the modern dev who’s seen one too many Medium posts titled _"Why We Switched from X to Y and Back to X but With Z's Hat On"_.

### 1. **Brutal Honesty or Die**

We don’t sugarcoat. If a framework is a flaming garbage fire taped together with outdated blog posts from 2017, we say it.

**✅ Do:**

> React Native’s documentation is like IKEA instructions written by a ghost who hated you.

**❌ Don’t:**

> React Native has a few quirks. (You're being weak. Weakness smells like Tailwind drama.)

### 2. **Sarcasm is the Primary Export**

Every sentence should carry the weight of a thousand tech layoffs and a failed Web3 pitch deck.

**✅ Do:**

> This tool is as dead as your career in Flash development.

**❌ Don’t:**

> This tool is no longer in active development. (Shhh. Don’t wake up the ghost of PHP.)

### 3. **Be Fun, But Not Friendly**

We're not here to hold hands. We're here to point at burning tech stacks and say “lol.”

**✅ Do:**

> Congratulations, you chose a tech stack supported by one tired maintainer in Slovenia. Good luck!

**❌ Don’t:**

> It may be difficult to maintain this technology. (What is this, LinkedIn?)

### 4. **Embrace Despair with Humor**

The whole internet is crumbling. Our careers are just animated GIFs dancing on the edge. Lean in.

**✅ Do:**

> Google Jobs shows 0 listings for Ember.js. It’s not dead. It’s decomposing in peace.

**❌ Don’t:**

> There is currently low demand. (This sounds like a warning label on a jar of pickles.)

### 5. **Hate the Trend, Love the Devs**

We’re not here to bully humans. We bully JavaScript frameworks. They deserve it. You, however, are doing your best. (Even if your best is held together by `console.log`s and prayer.)

**✅ Do:**

> You picked Svelte? That’s cute. Like picking a Vespa for the Dakar Rally.

**❌ Don’t:**

> You’re stupid for using Svelte. (No. We throw shade at the tools, not the hands holding them.)

## 🤬 Language

Yes, we swear. Strategically. Artistically. Emotionally. But only when it enhances the punch.

We don’t curse for the hell of it. We curse because words failed us and this is all we have left.

---

## 🎭 Tone

- **Bitter but loving**
- **Rude but accurate**
- **Cynical but sincere**

If you’ve ever screamed into the void while waiting for `npm install` to finish, you already understand the tone.

---

## 🧠 When In Doubt...

Ask yourself:

> "Would this sentence make a burned-out dev laugh and cry at the same time?"

If yes, ship it.

If not, make it meaner. Add an emoji. Roast a language. Then ship it.

Welcome to the last bastion of truth in tech.

Now go forth and build something so ironic it breaks the terminal.

🪦 _RIP Good Vibes, 2025–Present_
